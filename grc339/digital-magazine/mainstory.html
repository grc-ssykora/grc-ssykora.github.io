                            <h3>The Story of Monstera Deliciosa</h3>
                            <p>Monstera deliciosa is native to the rainforests of Central America, primarily found in Mexico. Its name, Monstera, derives from the Latin word "monstrum," which means "monstrous" or "abnormal." This name alludes to the plant's unusually shaped leaves, which often feature large splits and holes, resembling pieces of Swiss cheese.</p>
                            <p>The most iconic feature of Monstera deliciosa is its lush, fenestrated leaves. These perforations are thought to have evolved in response to the plant's natural habitat, allowing rain and debris to pass through while reducing wind resistance. As the plant matures, the leaves develop more splits and perforations, creating a captivating, wild appearance.</p>
                                
                            <figure>

                            <h3>Care Tips for a Happy Monstera</h3>
                            <p>Monstera deliciosa thrives in bright, indirect light. It should not be exposed to direct sunlight, as this can scorch the leaves. Ideally, place it near a window with filtered sunlight or in a room with plenty of ambient light.</p>
                            <p>One of the key secrets to Monstera care is maintaining even soil moisture. Water the plant when the top inch of soil feels dry to the touch. Ensure that the pot has good drainage to prevent overwatering, which can lead to root rot.</p>
                            <p>Monstera deliciosa prefers temperatures between 65-75°F (18-24°C). It also appreciates higher humidity levels. If your indoor environment is too dry, you can increase humidity by misting the leaves, using a humidifier, or placing a tray of water near the plant.</p>
                            <p>During the growing season (spring and summer), feed your Monstera every 4-6 weeks with a balanced, water-soluble fertilizer. Reduce or eliminate fertilization during the dormant season in fall and winter.</p>
                            <p>As your Monstera grows, you may need to prune it to maintain its shape and size. Trim any leggy or dead growth and remove dust from the leaves to ensure proper photosynthesis.</p>
